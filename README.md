## Overview

This project is a Spring Boot API designed to compare different numerical integration methods. It includes implementations for the following methods:

- **Lobatto Quadrature**
- **Trapezoidal Rule**
- **Simpsonâ€™s Rule**

The API also features error analysis, optimization, and various execution environments for performance comparison.

## Features

- Compare different numerical integration methods with a variety of input data.
- Use Jakarta Validation for input validation.
- Leverage JUnit for unit testing.
- Use JAS for equation solving and parsing.
- MXParser for mathematical parsing and evaluations.
- Bucket4j for rate-limiting API requests.
